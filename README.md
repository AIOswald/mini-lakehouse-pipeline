# mini-lakehouse-pipeline
A small end-to-end Databricks Lakehouse project that ingests raw CSV data into Delta (Bronze), applies cleaning and data-quality checks (Silver), builds curated analytics tables and KPIs (Gold), and demonstrates basic Spark performance tuning (naive vs. broadcast join) — all orchestrated as a Databricks multi-task job.
